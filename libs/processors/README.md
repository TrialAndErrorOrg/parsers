# Processors

These folders each contain a specific processor.
A processor is a function that takes a document and returns a document, such as a `.docx` file and spits out a `.tex` file.

Basically this is space to create specific processors for specific fucnctions.

## Current useful processors

- `docx-to-tex`: Converts a `.docx` file to a `.tex` file.
- `docx-to-html`: Converts a `.docx` file to a `.html` file, at the moment specifically for use with [Manifold](manifoldapp.org)
