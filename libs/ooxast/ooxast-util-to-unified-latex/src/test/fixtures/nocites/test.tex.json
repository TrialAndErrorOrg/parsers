Even when scientific failures are recognized, they are framed within the larger context of long-run success—”failing now to succeed later”—rather than as an integral part of the scientific process in its own right.

But where one structure collapses, another is built. The question is whether we need to be so radical. Can journals not simply reform their practices to allow for more diverse results to be published? Do we risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater?"
